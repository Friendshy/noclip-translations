# Noclip translations

Noclip uses translation strings for its localization system. For example:

This is an english translation example.
```
>en.json

"dashboard:"dashboard"
```


to write for lets say, spanish it would be:

```
>es.json

"dashboard:"tablero de mandos"
```

To start contributing please download or fork this repo and copy the en.json file to whatever language you are looking to support. 

- Your contribution will be reviewed to ensure you are not just copy and pasting from Google Translate. 

- Your translation must contain every string translation from the default english one.

- If your translation qualifies to be added to Noclip, you will receieve Rainbow for free and a Translator role on the Discord.

- Please name your locale translation file to the appropriate language code. For example: es for spanish, fr for french, etc.
